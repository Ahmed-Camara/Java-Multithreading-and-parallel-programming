# Multithreading-and-parallel-programming

Thread is actually an object that will facilitate the execution of task. Multithreading programming can make the program more responsive and interactive as well as enhance the program performance. To create a thread, we need to create the custom task class which will implement the Runnable interface and run that task from a thread.

OBJECTIVES:

1- Developp task classes by implementing the Runnable interface 2- Create Threads to run by using the methods in Thread class 3- Control animation in Thread and use Plateform.runlater to run the code in the app 4- use synchronized methods or blocks to synchronize threads to avoid race condition 5- to synchronize threads usings locks 6- facilitate threads communication 7- use resource-ordering to avoid deadlocks 8- create synchronized collections from Collections class 9- Develop parallel programs using the Fork 10- restrict concurrent number of task that access a shared resource with Semaphore
